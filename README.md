# Mapping UK SOC

These are a set of files to convert data organised by the different versions of the UK Standard Occupational Classification into newer versions. One file converts from SOC90 to SOC2000, another from SOC2000 to SOC2010, and the third consolidates SOC2010 to eliminate some discontinuities that emerge in the mapped data. Full documentation will follow, as well as the code that generates them.
